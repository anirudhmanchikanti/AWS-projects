	> Attach an Elastic IP to Web Server

		> Steps to attach Elastic IP

			Services -> EC2 -> Left pane -> NETWORK & SECURITY -> Click Elastic IP's -> Allocate New Address -> Amazon Pool -> Select/Checkmark EIP -> Actions > Associate Address > Select Web Server Instance > Associate		

	> Steps to setup Web Server

		> Once logged into Web Server, run following commands to setup web server

			> rpm -qi httpd

			> sudo yum -y install httpd

			> rpm -qi httpd

			> sudo netstat -ntpl | grep 80

			> sudo systemctl status httpd			
                                                      > sudo systemctl enable httpd
			> sudo systemctl start httpd

			> sudo systemctl status httpd

	> Developers use Source Code Management Tool i.e Github			

	> Ecommerce Application Code is hosted in 
	
		https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm-temp		

	> Connect to Web server and list the content of following directory
		
		> ls /var/www/html { DocumentRoot }	

	> Get the code to DocumentRoot using git

		> sudo yum -y install git

		> sudo git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm-temp.git  /var/www/html

		> ls /var/www/html

		> Browse the Public IP of Web Server
		
		> Now stop and start the server back, and see if the Elastic IP got changed ? As you can see it's the same, which is useful in DNS
