LAB - Additional Volumes

	> Launch Linux instance with AMI :: Amazon Linux 2 in public subnet and tag it as Linux

	> To check available disks using the following commands

		> lsblk - lsblk lists information about all the available block devices

		> df - report file system disk space usage

			> lsblk
			> df -h


	> Now create a 15 GB Additional volume and attach the volume to current running Linux instance


	> Steps to attach the Volumes to Linux Instance
	
		EC2 Dashboard > Volumes > Select 15 GB Volume > Actions > Attach > Select Linux Server
	
	> To check available disks using the following commands
		
		# lsblk
		# df -h

	
> mkfs is a command used to format storage device with specific file system, now will format the volume to ext4 filesystem	

> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf			

 > Create a directory of your choice to mount our new ext4 volume. I am using the name myvol
    
    	> sudo mkdir /mnt/myvol	
    	> sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/myvol	

    > Confirm with the df -h command
    	> df -h
	
    > Create few files in /myvol
    	> cd /mnt/myvol	
    	> ls  	
    	> sudo touch myfile.txt
    	> ls

Now you can attach the same volume for multiple instances and and check the file using same mount command 

> sudo mkdir /mnt/myvol	
> sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/myvol
