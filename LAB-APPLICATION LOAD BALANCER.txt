LAB - Application Load Balancer

This Lab provides a hands-on to Application Load Balancers. You'll create a load balancer that receives public HTTP traffic and sends it to your EC2 instances based on the content.

Before you begin
Complete the steps in Prepare Your VPC and EC2 Instances.
Launch 4 EC2 instances where 2 instances (pic 1 & pic 2) with picture content and other 2 instances (video 1 & video 2) with video content

Steps

On all four instances create a file called index.html /var/www/html/picture.html with the content as follow <h1>Instagram Loading</h1>
Instance - pic 1 - instance - /var/www/html/picture.html <h1>Picture1 from Insta</h1>
Instance - pic 2 - instance - /var/www/html/picture.html <h1>Picture2 from Insta</h1>
Instance - vid 1 - instance - /var/www/html/video.html <h1>Video1 from Insta</h1>
Instance - vid 2 - instance - /var/www/html/video.html <h1>Video2 from Insta</h1>

Now let's create target groups then will create Load balancer and will associate target groups
Create Target Group → Target Group Name (Pictures) → Health : index.html
Create Target Group → Target Group Name (Videos) → Health : index.html
Now i need to register ec2 instances to their specific target groups
Select the Pictures Target → Select Targets tab → Edit → Select Pictures instances Click Add to registered → Save
Select the Videos Target → Select Targets tab → Edit → Select Video instances Click Add to registered → Save


Now click create load balancer → Select Application Load balancer → Name : AppLB → Internet Facing → ipv4 → Listeners port 80 → Select proper VPC where instances are launched → Select AZ's/Subnets where instances are launched → Configure Security Settings to allow port 80 → Configure Routing → Select Existing target group → Choose Pictures → Register Targets → Review → Create → It's provisioning → Give it some time it will be active
Copy the DNS name of load balancer and check in browser, now it's going to the Pictures target coz by default i set it to Pictures
Now let's see how we can route the traffic based on request type
Now select Pictures target group → Description → I can see it's associated to AppLB
Now select Videos target group → Description → It's not associated to AppLB,  why is that ?? while creating an AppLB i should associate it to at least one target group
Now videos target group or any additional target group will not be associated with elastic load balancer until i create content rules that point traffic to video group

Now let's go back to the Elastic Load balancer select it → Listeners tab → the default action is forward to pictures → Now will create rules that is going to take traffic based on path and it will tell the App ELB where to route traffic.
Click View/Edit rules → This is the default rule you cannot change it, but you can add new rules, Upper tab besides Rules click add(+) → Click Insert Rule → Add condition select path is → type: *video* → forward to Videos Target Group → Save
Go back and in browser give the DNS name of load balancer with path picture.html

Go back and in browser give the DNS name of load balancer with path video.html
