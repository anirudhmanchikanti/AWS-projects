Try the above same in Ubuntu 18.04, Fails

Web App Setup - Ubuntu 18

The Package name is not httpd but apache2 and also a default web page index.html is already available in /var/www/html



Script for ubuntu server

#!/bin/bash
apt-get -y install apache2
apt-get -y install git
systemctl start apache2
rm /var/www/html/index.html
git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm.git /var/www/html


Now the above issue can be fixed by accessing metadata and applying some logical operations on top of it
